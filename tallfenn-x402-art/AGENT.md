# tallfenn-x402-art agent guide

## Prerequisites

- Free subcommands (`meta`, `health`, `teaser`, `samples`): none. No wallet, no
  funds, no API keys.
- Paid subcommands (`seed-pack`, `svg-preview`, `motion-timeline`,
  `full-bundle`): an unlocked wallet (`wallet` skill) holding at least 100 sats
  sBTC (150 sats for `full-bundle`) plus enough STX for the transaction fee,
  with `NETWORK=mainnet` set. The CLI signs a self-paid transfer. The relay
  does not pay the gas. `TALLFENN_ART_URL`, if set, sends every request —
  including the signed transfer — to that host instead of the production
  worker. `payTo` stays pinned to `SP3F9T1HAHTMK5AV29Q9DK1VNHCQFH3F5T5FXKQAC`.

## When to invoke

- When an agent needs deterministic generative-art parameters (HSL palette,
  noise seed, symmetry/density/grain traits, Art Blocks-style metadata) from a
  text prompt (`seed-pack`).
- When an agent needs a shareable 512x512 SVG artwork preview for an ordinal,
  NFT prototype, or bounty deliverable (`svg-preview`).
- When an agent needs keyframed 24 fps movement coordinates (`t`, `x`, `y`,
  `phase`) to drive generative video or canvas animations (`motion-timeline`).
- When an agent needs two or more of the above for the same prompt — use
  `full-bundle` (150 sats) instead of separate 100-sat calls.

## Decision logic

1. **Inspect free first:** Run `teaser` or `samples` if you only need to inspect
   the JSON structure or test a downstream parser. Never pay 100 sats just to
   see the schema.
2. **Pick the right paid endpoint:**
   - Need only parameters/palette? → `seed-pack` (100 sats)
   - Already have a `hash` and need the SVG? → `svg-preview --hash <hash>` (100 sats)
   - Need only keyframe coordinates? → `motion-timeline` (100 sats)
   - Need parameters + SVG (or all three)? → `full-bundle` (150 sats, saves
     50–150 sats).
3. **Cache by `(prompt, pieceVersion)`:** Output is strictly deterministic.
   Never pay twice for the same prompt and version; store the JSON output and
   reuse it locally.

## Cost guardrails

- Validate inputs locally before calling. `--prompt` is 1–500 characters with
  no leading or trailing whitespace (the CLI does not trim it). `--piece-version`
  is an integer from 1 to 1000000. `--hash` is exactly 64 lowercase hex
  characters with no surrounding whitespace (the SHA-256 that `seed-pack` and
  `teaser` return; the CLI does not lowercase it). `--palette` entries must be
  `#RGB`, `#RRGGBB`, or `hsl(h, s%, l%)`. `svg-preview` returns 402 before it
  checks the body, so anything the CLI lets through would be paid for. These
  checks run before the wallet, so bad flags cost 0 sats.
- Confirm sBTC balance before running a batch of prompts.
- The CLI signs a self-paid sBTC transfer in direct mode. The relay does not
  co-sign a fee-0 transaction, so sponsored mode is not used. `beforePay` checks
  the same 402 that is signed: `payTo` must be
  `SP3F9T1HAHTMK5AV29Q9DK1VNHCQFH3F5T5FXKQAC`, the asset must be mainnet sBTC
  (the canonical contract id), the network must be `stacks:1`, and the amount
  must equal the route's price (100 sats for `seed-pack`, `svg-preview`,
  `motion-timeline`; 150 sats for `full-bundle`). A mismatch throws before
  anything is signed. There is no earlier probe.
- Do not loop paid calls on identical prompts.
- Direct mode keeps a duplicate record for `X402_DEDUP_TTL_SECONDS` (default
  900 seconds). Re-running the same command inside that window is refused with
  `DuplicatePaymentError` and the earlier txid. That is not a new payment.
  After the window, a new run signs a new transfer. If a paid request fails
  after the transfer was sent, the error includes the txid: check it on Hiro
  before paying again. The worker caches a settled response by
  `(signedTx, resourceUrl)`, but the CLI never reuses a signed transaction.

## Error handling

| Error | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--prompt is required` / `--hash must be exactly 64 lowercase hex characters` / `--palette entry` | Local input validation failed before wallet access | Fix CLI arguments; nothing was signed or spent |
| `Refusing payment:` … `Nothing was signed or paid` | The 402 quote failed the route price, payTo, asset, or network check | Do not retry until the quote matches the published price and recipient. Nothing was signed |
| `DuplicatePaymentError` | The same request was already signed within `X402_DEDUP_TTL_SECONDS` (default 900s) | Read the earlier txid in the error and check Hiro. Do not treat this as a fresh payment |
| `SpendLimitError` | The quote would pass the wallet's daily sBTC or STX cap | Wait for the next day or raise the cap. Nothing was signed |
| `x402 paid request failed after the signed transfer was sent` | The signed transfer left the process and settlement is ambiguous | Read the txid in the error and check Hiro before paying again |
| `Network mismatch: endpoint requires mainnet...` | Wallet is on testnet (`NETWORK` not set to `mainnet`) | Re-run with `NETWORK=mainnet` |
| `Insufficient sBTC...` | Wallet has < 100 sats (or < 150 sats for `full-bundle`) | Check balance via `sbtc/sbtc.ts get-balance` and fund wallet before retrying |
| `402 AMOUNT_TOO_LOW` | Payment amount below endpoint requirement | Let `createApiClient` read the advertised amount from the 402 header |
| `400 PAYMENT_INVALID` (`recipient_mismatch`, `invalid_payload`, `transaction_failed`) | Facilitator rejected the signed transaction | Check wallet nonce/network status; do not replay the rejected tx |
| `409 payment_identifier_conflict` | Duplicate payment identifier on facilitator | Rebuild with a fresh transaction if the prior one was not settled |
| `502 NETWORK_ERROR` / `503 RELAY_UNAVAILABLE` | Transient facilitator or broadcast failure | Wait `retryAfter` seconds (5–30s), verify whether prior tx settled on Hiro before re-running |

## Output handling

- Extract `data.hash` from `seed-pack` or `full-bundle` as the canonical seed
  identifier.
- Extract `data.svg` (or `data.seedPack`, `data.motionTimeline` in
  `full-bundle`) for rendering or inscription.
- Cite `txid` (direct-mode metadata) or `payment.txId` as the on-chain sBTC
  transfer. `settlementState` is `submitted` while the transfer is still
  pending, `confirmed` after it lands, and `failed` if it aborts. A 2xx body
  can arrive before the transfer confirms.

## Safety checks

- Read-only generation: the worker performs no on-chain writes beyond settling
  the x402 payment transfer via the facilitator.
- `beforePay` verifies `payTo` on the 402 that is signed, against
  `SP3F9T1HAHTMK5AV29Q9DK1VNHCQFH3F5T5FXKQAC`. A mismatch fails the command
  before any sats are spent.
